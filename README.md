# Unredact

**Reveal what's hidden in redacted PDFs.**

Unredact uses computer vision, font-aware constraint solving, and LLM reasoning to figure out what text is hiding under those black bars. Upload a PDF, and it will detect redactions, calculate exactly which strings could fit based on pixel-width constraints, and let you visually verify guesses with a live overlay.

Everything runs in the browser — no server required.

## What it does

- **Detects redactions** automatically using computer vision, or manually by clicking
- **Solves for hidden text** by finding every string that fits the exact pixel width of a redaction, accounting for font metrics and kerning
- **Ranks results with AI** using Claude to score candidates by contextual fit with surrounding text
- **Lets you verify visually** by overlaying guessed text in green on the original document — if the characters align, the guess fits

## How it works

Unredact combines three techniques:

1. **Computer vision** — OCR (Tesseract.js) extracts visible text with character-level bounding boxes. A WASM module detects black rectangles and identifies the document's typeface and size via pixel-level font matching.

2. **Constraint solving** — Using the detected font's exact character widths (including kerning pairs), a WASM-compiled branch-and-bound solver enumerates every string that fits the redaction's pixel width within a configurable tolerance.

3. **LLM validation** — Claude reads the surrounding text context and scores each candidate for plausibility, then results are ranked by a composite of width fit and contextual score.

## Quick start

### Live version

The app is live at **[unredact.live](https://unredact.live)** — no installation needed. You just need a Claude API key for the LLM validation feature.

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alex-Gilbert/unredact.git
cd unredact

# Build the static site (requires Rust toolchain for WASM compilation)
make build-static

# Serve locally
make serve-static
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

### Prerequisites (for building)

- Rust toolchain with `wasm-pack` ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs), then `cargo install wasm-pack`)

### Development

For development with hot-reloading style path mapping:

```bash
make dev-static
```

This runs a dev server that maps flat URL paths to the source directories, so you can edit files in `unredact/static/` and see changes immediately.

### Deploy

```bash
make deploy    # Builds and deploys to Cloudflare Pages
```

## Usage guide

### 1. Upload a PDF

Drag and drop a redacted PDF onto the page, or use the file picker. The tool will automatically run OCR on every page and detect redactions and fonts.

### 2. Select a redaction

Click on a detected redaction (highlighted on the page). A panel opens with analysis details and solve options.

### 3. Choose a solve mode

| Mode | What it searches | Use case |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Name** | First names or last names from name dictionaries | Redacted names |
| **Full Name** | Two-word combinations (first + last) | Full name redactions |
| **Email** | Common email addresses | Redacted email addresses |
| **Word** | English nouns and adjectives from dictionary | General text redactions |
| **Enumerate** | All possible character combinations | Short redactions, anything goes |

### 4. Configure and solve

- Set the **character set** (lowercase, uppercase, capitalized)
- Adjust **tolerance** if results are too narrow or too broad
- Add **known characters** if you can tell what the first or last letter is
- For word mode, toggle **plural only** or adjust **vocabulary size**
- Click **Solve** — results stream in as they're found

### 5. Validate with AI

Click **Validate** to have Claude score each candidate based on the surrounding text context. Results are re-ranked by a composite score combining width fit and contextual plausibility. Requires a Claude API key (entered in settings).

### 6. Verify visually

Select a result to see it overlaid in green on the original document. If the green text aligns character-for-character with the surrounding visible text, the guess is a strong match. You can fine-tune font, size, position, and character spacing manually.

## Architecture

Unredact runs entirely in the browser as a static site:

- **WASM module** (compiled from Rust) — Constraint solver, redaction detection, font scoring, and text alignment
- **Tesseract.js** — OCR processing
- **Claude API** — LLM validation (called directly from the browser with your API key)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — No build step, ES6 modules, canvas rendering

All data (dictionaries, font metrics, name lists) is bundled as static assets. User settings and API keys are stored locally in IndexedDB.

### Legacy Python server

The `unredact/app.py` FastAPI server and `unredact/pipeline/` modules are the original server-side implementation. All processing has since been moved to run client-side via WASM and JavaScript. The Python code is retained for reference but is no longer needed to run the application.

The legacy server also depends on a separate Rust HTTP solver service (`solver_rs/`), which has been superseded by the WASM solver running directly in the browser.

### Useful commands

```bash
make build-static     # Build the static site to dist/
make serve-static     # Serve dist/ on port 8000
make dev-static       # Dev server with source path mapping
make deploy           # Build and deploy to Cloudflare Pages
make clean            # Clean build artifacts
```

# Unredact

**Reveal what's hidden in redacted PDFs.**

Unredact uses computer vision, font-aware constraint solving, and LLM reasoning to figure out what text is hiding under those black bars. Upload a PDF, and it will detect redactions, calculate exactly which strings could fit based on pixel-width constraints, and let you visually verify guesses with a live overlay.

## What it does

- **Detects redactions** automatically using computer vision, or manually by clicking
- **Solves for hidden text** by finding every string that fits the exact pixel width of a redaction, accounting for font metrics and kerning
- **Ranks results with AI** using Claude to score candidates by contextual fit with surrounding text
- **Lets you verify visually** by overlaying guessed text in green on the original document — if the characters align, the guess fits

## How it works

Unredact combines three techniques:

1. **Computer vision** — OCR extracts visible text with character-level bounding boxes. OpenCV detects black rectangles. A pixel-level font matcher identifies the document's typeface and size.

2. **Constraint solving** — Using the detected font's exact character widths (including kerning pairs), a parallel branch-and-bound solver written in Rust enumerates every string that fits the redaction's pixel width within a configurable tolerance.

3. **LLM validation** — Claude reads the surrounding text context and scores each candidate for plausibility, then results are ranked by a composite of width fit and contextual score.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Rust toolchain ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs))
- System packages:
  - **poppler** — PDF rendering (`libpoppler-cpp-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `poppler` on Arch/macOS)
  - **Tesseract** — OCR engine (`tesseract-ocr` on Debian/Ubuntu, `tesseract` on Arch/macOS)
  - **fontconfig** — Font lookup (`fontconfig` — usually preinstalled on Linux)
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) for LLM features

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alex-Gilbert/unredact.git
cd unredact

# Create Python virtualenv and install dependencies
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# Build the Rust constraint solver
make build-solver
```

### Configure

On first run, you'll be prompted for your Anthropic API key, which gets saved to `.env`:

```bash
make run
# Enter your Anthropic API key (from console.anthropic.com): sk-ant-...
```

Or create `.env` manually:

```bash
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here" > .env
```

### Run

```bash
make run
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

This starts both the Python web server (port 8000) and the Rust constraint solver (port 3100). Press `Ctrl+C` to stop everything.

## Usage guide

### 1. Upload a PDF

Drag and drop a redacted PDF onto the page, or use the file picker. The tool will automatically run OCR on every page and detect redactions and fonts.

### 2. Select a redaction

Click on a detected redaction (highlighted on the page). A panel opens with analysis details and solve options.

### 3. Choose a solve mode

| Mode | What it searches | Use case |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Name** | First names or last names from name dictionaries | Redacted names |
| **Full Name** | Two-word combinations (first + last) | Full name redactions |
| **Email** | Common email addresses | Redacted email addresses |
| **Word** | English nouns and adjectives from dictionary | General text redactions |
| **Enumerate** | All possible character combinations | Short redactions, anything goes |

### 4. Configure and solve

- Set the **character set** (lowercase, uppercase, capitalized)
- Adjust **tolerance** if results are too narrow or too broad
- Add **known characters** if you can tell what the first or last letter is
- For word mode, toggle **plural only** or adjust **vocabulary size**
- Click **Solve** — results stream in as they're found

### 5. Validate with AI

Click **Validate** to have Claude score each candidate based on the surrounding text context. Results are re-ranked by a composite score combining width fit and contextual plausibility.

### 6. Verify visually

Select a result to see it overlaid in green on the original document. If the green text aligns character-for-character with the surrounding visible text, the guess is a strong match. You can fine-tune font, size, position, and character spacing manually.

## Architecture

Unredact runs as two local services:

- **Python server** (FastAPI, port 8000) — Handles PDF processing, OCR, font detection, redaction detection, LLM calls, and serves the web UI
- **Rust solver** (Axum, port 3100) — Runs the parallel constraint solver, streams results back via SSE

The frontend is vanilla JavaScript with no build step. It uses canvas for rendering and SSE for real-time result streaming.
